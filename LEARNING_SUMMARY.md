## Learning journey

For the purpose of learning more about the Microsoft Power Apps, I have decided to go with the no-cod/low code approach for the learning pathway. The reason for that is that I would like to take the coding approach during the break preparing myself for next year university course which is on machine learning. Also, I find it fascinating that IT has become more approachable to general public than before. As I would have never thought people that do not know how to code can use a user-friendly interface such as Power App to create an App. This also bridges the gap between my existing traditional development knowledge and how Power Apps works (app logic, user interface creation, and data flow) to create an App.

This module has a detailed module in explaining fusion development letting me understand how software development works with a business team with a scenario. It is also great to learn things such as tech intensity (technology adoption, individual capabilities, organization trust) letting me understand the importance of collaboration work even when they are not working in the same team (development team) as I understood the importance of working with effective communication in a development team but neglected importance of working with other people such as business professional. 

In the module of learning to create an app as a traditional developer, it is a new experience to know that with the power app along with other services, I m able to create an actual mobile app with low code. Power Fx is a new experience for me and is interesting to use on canvas-based Power Apps. Furthermore, as someone with minimal experience with API, I get to experience integrate a Web API using the Azure API Management which enhanced my learning about API.
